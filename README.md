# Requirements

First of all you need to create a virtual environment and install the packages,

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the packages,

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If for some reason this not works, you can install the packages manually.

```
pip install numpy pandas arm_pyart nexradaws
```

# How to run

```
python main.py
```
